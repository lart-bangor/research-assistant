TASK_LOCALISATION_LABEL: Final[str] = r"^([A-Z][a-z]{2}){2,}_[A-Z][a-z]{2}_[A-Z]{2}(\.\w*)?"
"""Regular expression for task localisation labels.

Localisation labels consist of three obligatory and one optional parts:

1. Two or more ISO 639 Alpha-3 codes for the language(s) targeted by the localisation.
   These should have the initial letter capitalised, the remaining letters in lower case.
   Use :code:`Und` for *undetermined* languages (e.g. a partially generic localisation).
   The code :code:`Mis` can be used for a language which does not have a code assigned yet,
   but in principle could be assigned a code (though it will be preferable to code a relevant
   macrolanguage where possible). The Codes :code:`Mul` (multiple languages where a single code
   cannot be applied sensibly) and :code:`zxx` (non-linguistic content/language code not
   applicable) should probably be avoided altogether.
2. One ISO 639 Alpha-3 code for the display language of the localisation.
   Follow the same coding guideline as for (1) above.
3. An all-uppercase ISO 3166 Alpha-2 code to indicate the (approximate) location for which
   the localisation is applicable.
4. Optionally a full stop followed by an alphanumeric (A-Za-z0-9_) descriptor, which can be
   used to further specify otherwise similarly labelled localisations (e.g. multiple options
   for a consent form). Note that these are currently ignored for task localisation
   transitions (so a task with localisation AaaBbb_Aaa_AA.foo will simply propagate AaaBbb_Aaa_AA
   as a localisation) - this is so duplicate localisations are not needed for all possible
   task sequences, but may be subject to change in future.
