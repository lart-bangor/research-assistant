        "titleLabel":"Study Title", 
        "titleInfo":"Reaction times and EEG recording of bilingual speakers.",
        "purposeLabel": "What is the purpose of the research?",
        "purposeInfo": "This study is part of a larger research project investigating the reaction times and EEG recordings of bilinguals in communities across Europe. The project aims to find out more about how bilinguals react to audio and visual stimuli in several areas across Europe, including Wales, Belgium and Italy.",
        "whyLabel": "Why am I being invited to participate?",
        "whyInfo": "You have been chosen because as a speaker of Welsh and English you will be able to understand audio stimuli in more than one language.",
        "commitLabel": "Do I have to take part?",
        "commitInfo": "It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you do decide to take part you should indicate your agreement on the online consent form.<br />You can still withdraw at any time, and you do not need to give a reason.",
        "whatLabel": "What am I being invited to do?",
        "whatInfo": "You will be asked to react to some visual stimuli as well as to audio stimuli in both of the languages you speak, by pressing keys on a computer keyboard. While you are engaged in this task, an electroencephalography system will record your brain activity via electrodes placed on the surface of your scalp. The full procedure will take between one and a half and two hours to complete, and there are no other commitments or restrictions associated with participating.",
        "concernLabel": "What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?",
        "concernInfo": "Participating in the research is not anticipated to cause you any disadvantages or discomfort beyond what you might experience in everyday life. Please note that some of the visual stimuli contain potentially unpleasant images (e.g. spiders), which some participants might find uncomfortable. Please let the researcher know if you think this might be an issue.", 
        "concern1Label": "What if something goes wrong?",
        "concern1Info": "If you have any complaints about the project in the first instance you can contact any member of the research team.<br />If you feel your complaint has not been handled to your satisfaction you can contact Bangor University’s Governance Services to take your complaint further (see below).",
        "confidentialLabel": "Will my taking part in this project be kept confidential?",
        "confidentialInfo": "All the information that we collect about you during the course of the research will be kept strictly confidential. <br />You will not be identified or identifiable in any reports or publications. Any data collected about you in the electronic questionnaire will be stored in a Bangor University computer protected by passwords and by other relevant security processes and technologies. <br/> Data may be shared in an anonymised form to allow reuse by other researchers. These anonymised data will not allow you to be identified or identifiable. <br /> We also ask that you do not disclose anything about what you did during this study to anyone outside of the research team. It is important that information regarding the nature of the research remains confidential.",
        "taskTypeLabel": "What type of information will be sought from me and why is the collection of this information relevant for achieving the research project's objectives?",
        "taskTypeInfo": "The task will require you to react to different audio and visual stimuli while your EEG (electroencephalogram) is being recorded. The project is interested in your reaction times to these types of stimuli and in your brain activity while reactions take place.",
        "dataUseLabel": "What will happen to the results of the research project?",
        "dataUseInfo": "Results of the research will be published as quantitative data, which means that no single individual will be identified in any report or publication.",
        "whoLabel": "Who is organising and funding the research?",
        "whoInfo": "The project is a partnership involving <i>Prof Marco Tamburelli</i> and <i>Prof Guillaume Thierry</i> of Bangor University, and is funded by the UK's Economic and Social Research Council.",
        "ethicsLabel": "Who has ethically reviewed the project?",
        "ethicsInfo": "This project has been ethically approved by the Research Ethics Committee in the College of Arts, Humanities and Business at Bangor University. <br />This is the body that carries out the ethics review procedure and monitors the application and delivery of the College's and University's Research Ethics Guidelines and Ethics Approval Procedures.",
