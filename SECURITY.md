# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We generally aim to actively support the latest minor version until we release
the next one (e.g. we will release patches for 0.4.x until we release 0.5.0).
However, note that this project is currently still in an early stage (marked by
the 0.x.z version number) meaning that the time between such updates may be
relatively short.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.5.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.4.x   | :x:                |
| 0.3.x   | :x:                |
| < 0.3   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If the vulnerability or security issue can be shared openly without directly
compromising the security of a user or of the participant data they may be
collecting with the app, we would encourage you to report this via the public
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/lart-bangor/research-assistant/issues).

However, **if there is any direct risk to a user or participant data** which
would arise as a direct consequence of publicly sharing the vulnerability,
please report this as a *private*
(GitHub Security Advisory)[https://github.com/lart-bangor/research-assistant/security/advisories].
We will aim to at least acknowledge such advisories within one week. If you
do not receive a reply in that time please feel free to contact the project
maintainers at <f.breit@bangor.ac.uk> and <m.tamburelli@bangor.ac.uk>,
ideally with a link to the advisory on GitHub.
