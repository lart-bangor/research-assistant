About the Research Client
=========================

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The LART Research Client is a freely available open-source app that aims to make research in the
areas of bilingualism, sociolinguistics, language attitudes, regional/minority/minoritized
languages and related fields both easier and more comparable, standardised and reproducible.

The current version (LART Research Client |version|) implements a digital informed consent form and
two implementations of the Language and Social Background Questionnaire (LSBQ)
[Anderson-Mak-EtAl-2018]_.

The main version of the LSBQ includes all the material from the standard
LSBQ but makes some slight adaptations for greater flexibility in use across a variety of settings
and populations (e.g. educational levels, which are specific to the Canadian/North American system
in the original LSBQ; see Section 3.1 below).

The other version, which we termed the LSBQ-RML, is a strict subset
of the standard LSBQ which retains all the most informative sections from the standard LSBQ but
includes adaptations that make the questionnaire suitable for use


with some adaptations geared specifically towards the study of bilingual populations who speak a
majority language and a regional / minority / heritage or otherwise minoritized language.

While it retains all the most informative sections from the original LSBQ, it also includes
adaptations that aim at making the questionnaire more flexible (e.g., for use outside of Canada,
which the original LSBQ was based in) as well as allowing more standardised comparison across
bilingual populations (particularly in relation to educational level. See section 3.1 below).

The main functionality of LSBQe resides in its format as a stand-alone app that can run on desktop
and laptop computers without the need for web connectivity. This makes it highly usable both in a
lab environment as well as in the field, for example when collecting data in remote areas with
inconsistent internet access.
