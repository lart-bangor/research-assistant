About the Research Client
=========================

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The LART Research Client is a freely available open-source app that aims to make research in the
areas of bilingualism, sociolinguistics, language attitudes, regional/minority/minoritized
languages and related fields both easier and more comparable, standardised and reproducible.

The current version (LART Research Client |version|) implements a digital informed consent form and
two implementations of the Language and Social Background Questionnaire (LSBQ)
[Anderson-Mak-EtAl-2018]_.

The main version of the LSBQ includes all the material from the standard
LSBQ but makes some slight adaptations for greater flexibility in use across a variety of settings
and populations (e.g. educational levels, which are specific to the Canadian/North American system
in the original LSBQ; see Section 3.1 below).

The other version, which we termed the LSBQ-RML, is a strict subset
of the standard LSBQ which retains all the most informative sections from the standard LSBQ but
includes adaptations that make the questionnaire suitable for use


with some adaptations geared specifically towards the study of bilingual populations who speak a
majority language and a regional / minority / heritage or otherwise minoritized language.

While it retains all the most informative sections from the original LSBQ, it also includes
adaptations that aim at making the questionnaire more flexible (e.g., for use outside of Canada,
which the original LSBQ was based in) as well as allowing more standardised comparison across
bilingual populations (particularly in relation to educational level. See section 3.1 below).

The main functionality of LSBQe resides in its format as a stand-alone app that can run on desktop
and laptop computers without the need for web connectivity. This makes it highly usable both in a
lab environment as well as in the field, for example when collecting data in remote areas with
inconsistent internet access.


Who/what the Reserch Client is for
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The app was developed to ease the collection, storage and transfer of data from commonly employed
tasks such as the collection of informed consent and linguistic background questionnaires, while
at the same time increasing standardisation, comparability and reproducibility of the administered
tasks.

At present the Research Client (version |version|) implements an informed consent facility and two
variants of the Language and Social Background Questionnaire (one very close to the standard LSBQ,
the other adapted for use with potentially unwritten regional- and/or minority languages).
However, we're actively working on adding further tasks to the Research Client and it has been
designed in such a way that it can be easily extended by researchers (or research groups)
with just a basic knowledge of Python, JavaScript and HTML needed to implement additional tasks
(see the :doc:`developers/index` for more info). Translating an existing task for a new language or
language pair is even easier and can be done by just editing a simple
`JSON <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON>`_ file in a text editor (see :doc:`tutorials/translating-tasks`).

Licensing
^^^^^^^^^

The L’ART Research Client and its implementation of the LSBQe are free and open source. The app is
dual licensed under the terms of the `Affero General Public License <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html>`_
(the AGPL) and the `European Union Public License <https://commission.europa.eu/content/european-union-public-licence_en>`_
(the EUPL). Dual licensing means that you are free to choose under which of the two license’s
terms you want to use it. 

Both licenses allow you to:

- Use the app and its functionality freely (as in freedom) and for free (as in free beer) in your
  work, whether commercial or non-commercial. 
- Modify or otherwise make adaptations to the app and its source code, as long as you yourself make
  those changes available to others under the same license terms (or the terms of another compatible
  license where this is expressly permitted by the AGPL or EUPL). 
- Allow you to add yourself to the credits/copyright notice when you modify the software, as long as
  you do not remove, materially change, or misrepresent in any way the copyright and author attribution
  notes as they appear in the app, its source code, documentation, distributions (e.g. installers), etc.
  This means that: 
- Naturally, if you intend on modifying and/or improving the Research Client, we would appreciate it
  if you would share those developments with us so we can incorporate any improvements and enhancements
  into the official version of the app. 
- Where possible we would also strongly encourage you to retain the dual licensing model, as we
  believe this ensures maximal adoptability and reusability across a large variety of potential
  users in different parts of the world.
