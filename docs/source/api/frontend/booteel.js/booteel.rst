booteel.js
==========

The Booteel Frontend Library.

The Booteel Frontend Library provides functionality to make Python's eel module work
and interact nicely with a Bootstrap-based frontend. This JavaScript library implements
the frontend side of the Booteel functionality, while the Python module
:doc:`../../generated/research_assistant.booteel` implements the backend functionality.

.. note::
    Unfortunately, booteel.js has thus far been insufficiently annotated to provide API
    documentation here. We will aim to get this ready in due course - in the meantime
    please refer to the backend booteel API and inspection of the :file:`booteel.js`
    file.
