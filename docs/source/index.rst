Welcome to LART Research Client documentation!
==============================================

The LART Research Client is a freely available open-source app that aims to make life easier for
researchers working on bilingualism, sociolinguistics, language attitudes, and
regional/minority/minoritized languages.
The app was developed to ease the collection, storage and transfer of data from commonly employed
tasks such as the collection of informed consent and linguistic background questionnaires, while
at the same time increasing standardisation, comparability and reproducibility of the administered
tasks.

At present the Research Client (version |version|) implements an informed consent facility and two
variants of the Language and Social Background Questionnaire (one very close to the standard LSBQ,
the other adapted for use with potentially unwritten regional- and/or minority languages).
However, we're actively working on adding further tasks to the Research Client and it has been
designed in such a way that it should be relatively straight-forward for researchers/research groups
with basic knowledge of Python, JavaScript and HTML to implement additional tasks (see the
:doc:`developers/index` for more info), and translating an existing task for a new language or
language pair is as simple as editing a `JSON <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON>`_ file in a
text editor (see :doc:`tutorials/translating-tasks`).
