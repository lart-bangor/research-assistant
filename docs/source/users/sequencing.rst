Task Sequencing
---------------

The task sequencing settings allow researchers to configure which tasks (if any) should follow the completion of a specific task. 
For example, with the default settings, when the informed consent task is completed the participant will be automatically advanced
to the LSBQe, and when the LSBQe is complete they will be sent back to the app home screen.
