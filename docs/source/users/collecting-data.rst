Collecting Data
===============

Starting data collection and obtaining consent 
----------------------------------------------
There are two possible paths available to the researcher to collect data with the L’ART Research Client.
Your preference will depend on how you wish to obtain informed consent from your participants. 

Should you wish to obtain your participants’ consent on paper for any reason (e.g., you require your participant’s signature, or you prefer to work with physical copies of ethics-related documentation)
then you will start data collection by clicking directly on the research tool you require (e.g., **LSBQe**) under :guilabel:`‘Choose a task’` on the app’s home screen.   

The second option offers the researcher an integrated digital avenue to obtain informed consent, which negates the
need to handle physical information sheets, consent forms and signatures. 

This can be done by using the generic consent form provided (see section **[NUMBER]**) or by linking it to your
own digital consent form (see section **[NUMBER]** for instructions on how to add a custom consent form).

To obtain consent digitally, open the side menu on the top left-handby clicking on the "burger menu" icon. 
Then click on :guilabel:`informed consent`.

After selecting the required language version and entering a unique participant ID, your study’s consent form, 
information sheet and eligibility criteria will appear below. 

If the participant gives their consent and confirms their eligibility through marking their respective boxes, they will be
automatically advanced to the start screen for the first task (at present always the LSBQe).  

The task start screen is the same start screen that researchers who opt for the LSBQe without digital
informed consent will see after they select the LSBQe task from the app home screen.

The next sub-section discusses how to collect LSBQe responses with the app.


Collecting LSBQe responses
---------------------------

Upon starting the LSBQe, you are first asked to enter the relevant information for your study. These are:

#. Which version of the LSBQe you require, i.e. what localisation is pertinent to your study, which determines factors
   such as the primary (and possibly secondary) language displayed during the LSBQe, the suggested list of alternative 
   languages, and the education level indicators.

#. A researcher ID, e.g., the name of the researcher conducting your experiment.

#. The location, i.e., the area, city, or town where the research is being undertaken.  

#. A participant ID, i.e., the unique pre-assigned ID for your participant.

#. Consent confirmation, i.e. whether the participant has given their consent (either digitally or on paper).  

.. note::
    If you have collected consent via the digital consent form in-app, the app will pre-populate the information
    on this page using the information entered previously on the informed consent form.

The task start screen is followed by the three main sections of the LSBQe on Language and Social Background, Language and Dialect Background, and Community Language Use Behaviour respectively. 

*For more details on the contents of the LSBQe and how this differs from the standard version of the LSBQ, see the documentation of the LSBQe [insert link]*

**User input on the LSBQe:**


This sub-section describes how user input is collected on the LSBQe. While the LSBQe can be completed with a
touch interface or keyboard-only input, we strongly recommend that users are provided with access to both a
keyboard and a pointing device (e.g., a mouse or trackpad), as this ensures the best user experience and the
sliders used to collect continuous data are more accurate when used with a pointing device rather than a keyboard.


Any mandatory fields that haven’t been completed by the participant will be flagged up if the user attempts to continue
to the next page without having fully completed any section of the LSBQe or the response entered in a field is invalid 
(e.g. text entered in a field expecting a date). 

The user is given instructions on how they should complete the missing fields if this happens. 

For researchers using the app, or a specific localisation of the LSBQe for the first time, it might be useful to complete 
the LSBQe and purposely leave all fields blank before trying to submit so they can read through and familiarise themselves
with the user-feedback provided for each field.  


.. figure:: figures/figure13.png
      :width: 600
      :alt: Screenshot of unanswered mandatory fields flagged in red.

      Figure 13 - Mandatory fields that remain unanswered or contain invalid input will be flagged in red


A significant portion of the LSBQe’s answers make use of sliders. Sliders are displayed in a lighter hue with their indicator
displayed in the middle by default, and they have to be moved **at least once** for the answer to be valid. Once moved, the slider
will turn a darker shade of blue to show that the slider is active and has been moved by the participant.

.. // see if I can import color styles for text - s5defs.txt

Should the participant want to keep the slider in the middle of the bar, the slider will need to be moved once and then moved back to the middle point of the bar.

If the participant fails to move the slider, a red flag will appear **(see Figure 13)** and the participant will not be able to advance 
*(though note that some sliders provide a ""not applicable" tickbox, which negates the need for the user to interact with that slider).*

Once the three main sections of the LSBQe have been completed, and before submitting the data, the participant will be asked if there’s anything else
that they think is important for the researchers to know. If so, they may enter this information in the box provided. This is optional, however,
it can be an effective way to elicit qualitative data from the participant, and it gives participants the chance to clarify or alert the researchers
to anything they thought might not have been accurately captured by the standardised approach of the LSBQe.

Collecting AGT responses
-------------------------

Loading Recordings for the AGT
******************************


The Audio Guise Test (AGT) allows users to run either a Matched Guise Technique (MGT; Lambert, Hodsgon, Gardner & Fillenbaum, 1960)
or a Verbal Guise Technique (VGT; Markel, Eisler & Reese, 1967). (See **Breit et al., 2023** for more details)

Differentiation between MGT or VGT is executed via your audio recordings.

Firstly, the AGT requires thirteen recordings in order to function. Eight recordings are classed as experimental recordings, four are classed as filler recordings and one is a practice recording.

For an MGT setup, you must load **eight experimental recordings** from **four speakers**
with each speaker providing a recording in either language variety. 

For a VGT setup, you would load eight experimental recordings from eight speakers, with four speakers
providing a recording in one language variety, and the other four speakers providing a recording in the other language variety.

What to do with the four fillers are left up to the researcher. for instance, in an MGT setup, continuity with experimental stimuli may be preferred,
so the four fillers could be recorded by two speakers, with both speakers providing a recording in each language variety.
Contrarily, the researcher may prefer all fillers to be recorded by one speaker in one language.

The practice guise is presented first during an AGT and allows the participant to familiarise themselves with an AGT without testing experimental stimuli.
Practice stimulus design is decided by the researcher, for instance, a researcher may wish to produce a recording of themselves talking about a neutral
topic for the same length as the experimental and filler recordings.

Sounds files must be labelled appropriately in order for the AGT to execute the sound files.

Practice guise should be marked with “practice”; fillers should be marked with “F” plus the number of the filler; and experimental guises should be marked “s” plus number to denote your speaker, then underscored
before either “maj” or “rml” denoting the language variety. These are labels that must be assigned on the file names relating to the respective language varieties of AGT recordings, it is the researcher’s decision
which language they assign the “maj” label to, and which language they assign the “rml” label to. Language variety should be **consistent for all speaker recordings**, so in the example below in Figure 25, “maj” should
indicate Chinese recordings and “rml” should indicate English recordings consistently. 

.. note::

It should be noted that the example shown in Figure 25 is for an MGT.

**All sound files must be in mp3 format.**

To load your own recordings for the AGT, firstly, open the folder :guilabel:`[mgt]` by following the path below:

:guilabel:`C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\LART\Research Client\lart_research_client\web\audio\mgt`

Create a new folder which follows the ISO standard code sequence (see XX for standard code sequence generating) to hold the sound files for your AGT.
For example, for an AGT set-up to work with Chinese-English bilinguals in Singapore and use English as the language of presentation,
you would create a folder called **“ZhoEng_Eng_SG”**, as follows:

.. figure:: figures/figure28.png
      :width: 600
      :alt: Screenshot of folders

      Figure 28 - New folder ZhoEng_Eng_SG created following the ISO standard code sequence

Inside your folder, paste your own sound files but copy the standard code sequence described as above for file names for naming your sound files.

      :width:  600
      :alt: Screenshot of sound file names

      Figure 29 - Sound file names for AGT following the standard code sequence
 
Your files should now be played when you start the AGT and select the desired AGT version on the start menu.
