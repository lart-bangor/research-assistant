Setting up data collection and obtaining consent 
================================================

There are two possible paths available to the researcher to collect data with the
L’ART Research Client. Your preference will depend on how you wish to obtain informed
consent from your participants. 

Should you wish to obtain your participants’ consent on paper for any reason (e.g., you
require your participant’s signature, or you prefer to work with physical copies of
ethics-related documentation) then you will start data collection by clicking directly on
the research tool you require under *Choose a task* on the app’s home screen.

In the current version (|version|), the tasks available are: :guilabel:`LSBQe`,
:guilabel:`AToL`, :guilabel:`AGT`, and :guilabel:`Memory Game`.

The second option offers the researcher an integrated digital avenue to obtain informed
consent, which negates the need to handle physical information sheets, consent forms and
signatures. 

This can be done by using the generic consent form provided (see Figures 16 & 17 below)
or by linking it to your own digital consent form 

.. (see section **[insert link]** for instructions on how to add a custom consent form). << Ask where this is on the doc<<


To obtain consent digitally, open the side menu on the top left-handby clicking on the
"burger menu" icon. Then click on :guilabel:`Informed Consent`.

After selecting the required language version and entering a unique participant ID, your study’s consent form, information sheet and eligibility criteria will appear below. 

If the participant gives their consent and confirms their eligibility through marking their respective boxes, they will be
automatically advanced to the start screen for the first task (see `Task Sequencing <file:///C:/Users/admin/Documents/lart-research-client/docs/build/html/users/configuration.html#task-sequencing>`_ on how to set this).  

The task start screen is the same start screen that researchers who opt for the LSBQe without digital informed consent will see after they select a task from the app's home screen. 

.. The next section discusses how to collect responses for each task available in the L'ART Research Client: **LSBQe, AToL,** and **AGT**.
