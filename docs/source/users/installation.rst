3. If you have Microsoft Defender active, you may be warned about running an unrecognised app. This is
   expected behaviour for unsigned Software downloaded from the internet, and is meant to get you to check
   that you've downnloaded the Software from a reputable source before running it 'this is fine if you've
   used our official link **above**'. Click \'Run anyway'\ to continue with the installation.

4. Select you preferred install mode. We recommend choosing \'Install for me only'\ for most use cases, which
   will install the app only for the current user. **However** you may wish to install the app for all users.
   For example, if you're installing on a shared university or lab computer and want to centrally manage the 
   installation for all users (This requires Administrator privileges). 
   If in any doubt, choose \'Install for me only'\

6. Read and accept the licence agreement [INSERT LINK]. You must accept the agreement before installation can begin.


7. Select the destination location for your app. Normally you should be able to leave this at the path
   already suggested by the installer, which will be the default directory for app installation for your system
   and the chosen installation mode. Make sure you have at least 65MB of free disk space on your device.
   Click \'browse'\ if you wish to change the installation path of the app.  


8. Click ‘Install’ to install the L’ART Research Client app on your device. 


9. Complete setup by clicking ‘Finish’ and enjoy.
