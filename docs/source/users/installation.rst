   .. note::

      If you have Microsoft Defender active, you may be warned about running an unrecognised app.
      
      This is expected behaviour for unsigned software downloaded from the internet. It is meant to get you to
      check that you've downnloaded the Software from a reputable source before running it.
      
      *This is fine if you've used our official download link above!*
      
      Click :guilabel:`Run anyway` to continue with the installation.

#. Select you preferred install mode.

   We recommend choosing :guilabel:`Install for me only` for most use cases, which
   will install the app only for the current user.
   
   *However*, you may wish to install the app for all users. For example, if you're installing on a
   shared university or lab computer and want to centrally manage the installation for all users
   (requires administrator privileges).

   If in any doubt, choose :guilabel:`Install for me only`.

#. Select the destination location for your app.

   Normally you should be able to leave this at the path already suggested by the installer,
   which will be the default directory for app installation for your system and the chosen
   installation mode.
   
   Make sure you have at least 65MB of free disk space on your device.
   
   Click :guilabel:`Browse...` if you wish to change the installation path of the app.
