System requirements
===================

Operating systems
-----------------

The L’ART Research Client has been developed and tested primarily on Windows 10 and 11 (64bit Intel and AMD architectures). 

The installer and app will probably also work on 64bit versions of Windows 8, but we do not officially support this. 
The app is in principle compatible with current versions of MacOS, Linux, and BSD, but this currently requires 
installation/building from source (see Developer’s Guide). 

We have plans to officially support these platforms with the version 1.0 stable release in the near future.


**Minimal requirements:**

- 64bit Intel, AMD, or otherwise x64 compatible processor, 2.4GHz. 

- 65MB free disk space. 

- 4GB RAM. 


**Recommended requirements:** 

- 64bit Intel or AMD processor, 3.0GHz dual-core. 

- 200MB free disk space. 

- 8GB RAM. 

**Tested System Configurations**

We have successfully tested the app on the following systems: 

- Dell Inspiron 7620 2-in-1 (Intel i7-1260P, 16GB RAM, Windows 11 64-bit). 

- Dell Latitude 5520

- Dell XPS 6520

- Lenovo ThinkPad
