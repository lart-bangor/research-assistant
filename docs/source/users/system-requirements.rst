Compatibility and Requirements
==============================

Operating systems
-----------------

The L’ART Research Assistant has been developed and tested primarily on Windows 10 and 11 (64-bit Intel and AMD architectures). 

The installer and app will probably also work on 64-bit versions of Windows 8, but we do not officially support this. 
The app is in principle compatible with current versions of MacOS, Linux, and BSD, but this currently requires 
installation/building from source (see :ref:`developer-guide`). 

We have plans to officially support these platforms with the version 1.0 stable release in the near future.

System requirements
-------------------

**Minimal requirements:**

- 64-bit Intel, AMD, or otherwise x64 compatible processor, 2.4GHz. 

- 65MB free disk space. 

- 4GB RAM. 


**Recommended requirements:**

- 64-bit Intel or AMD processor, 3.0GHz dual-core. 

- 200MB free disk space. 

- 8GB RAM. 

Required Software
-----------------

You must have a current version of the `Google Chrome browser <https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/>`_ installed. The L’ART Research Assistant relies on this to provide its User Interface.
