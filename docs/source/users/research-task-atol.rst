Research task: AToL
===================

The AToL begins with a start screen akin to the one in **(1.4)** where you must select AToLa version, input Researcher ID, Location, Participant ID
and confirm that consent has been obtained by ticking the relevant box.

You will not be able to advance without completing each respective part of the start screen (see Figure 21).

The next screen asks the participant to rate the relevant languages, depending on the AToL version selected.

The majority language always appears first due to sociolinguistic plausibility, for instance, because all
instructions appear in the majority language in the original AToL versions for the LART research client app.

The bipolar adjective pairs are always generated in a random order. The AToL presents the statement “The language is…” followed by the AToL’s bipolar adjective pairs
which are rated by using the sliders as mentioned in 1.4.1. The AToL is a task that involves exclusively using sliders, and the order of the adjective pairs is randomised
for each participant. 

For ease of analysis, your result file for a given participant (see section ???) reports the order in which the adjectives were presented for that participant.
