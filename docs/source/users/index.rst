The L'ART Research Client Users' Guide covers everything you need to know to install the Research Client, 
set it up and begin data collection.

For users who wish to customise any of the tasks or add new translations, there are **Quick Tutorials** to help you through the process.
For developers who may want to contrribute further developments to the Research Client or build additional tasks, a technical documentation
can be found in the **Developer's Guide**.
