Users' Guide
============

In the L'ART Research Client Users' Guide we cover everything you need to know to install
the Research Client, set it up for your experiment, and get going with collecting data.

More information on how to adapt tasks is provided in the **Quick Tutorials**, and technical
documentation for developing additional tasks or customising the Research Client is
contained in the **Developer's Guide**.

If you are looking for something specific, you can also **search** the Users' Guide.
