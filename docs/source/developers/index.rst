Developer Guide
===============

Welcome to the L'ART Research Assistant Developer Guide. This is our "essential reading" for anyone
who wants to contribute, enhance, integrate or otherwise modify the Research Assistant. It will
cover everything from contribution guidelines and setting up the development environment to
understanding how the code is organised and how to build the app and the documentation from source.

You may also want to have a look at the :ref:`api_documentation`, which covers both the Python APIs
for the backend and the JavaScript APIs for the frontend.
