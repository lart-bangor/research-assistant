                    This study is part of a larger research project investigating bilingualism across Europe. 
                    <br /> The project aims to find out more about bilinguals in several areas across Europe, including Wales. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <li>Why am I being invited to participate?  </li>
                    You have been chosen because you are a bilingual Welsh-English speaker. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <li>Do I have to take part? </li>
                    It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you do decide to take part you should indicate your agreement on the online consent form.

                <p>

                    <br /> We estimate that they full procedure will take you about 20 minutes to complete. 
                    <br />There are no other commitments or restrictions associated with participating. 

                </p>

                <p>
                    <li> What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?</li>
